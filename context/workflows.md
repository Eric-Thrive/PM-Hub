# Workflows

## Morning Startup (`/update`)

### What Claude PM Copilot Does

Start at **Phase 2: Triage** using available context from:
- `context/priorities.md` (always read)
- Linear (always check)
- HubSpot — check weekly activity across all owners for recent client/partner engagement relevant to priorities
- Gmail for meeting transcripts (Gemini notes)
- Slack DMs for self-notes that need processing
- Any context Eric provides in chat

### Phase 3: Briefing

1. **Curate Focus Now picks** — choose the 3 most strategically important items with rationale (not just overdue items — what actually matters most given meetings, blockers, milestones)
2. **Present briefing in chat** — summarize today's agenda, top priorities, blockers, and action items
