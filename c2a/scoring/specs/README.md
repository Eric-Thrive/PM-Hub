# C2A Scoring Specification JSONs

Per-instrument scoring specifications that define how raw responses are converted to scored values. Each JSON contains item definitions, subscale groupings, scoring rules, and construct mappings.

## Status

- 4 instruments need changes: CAAS-SF, SPCC, IRI, SFCQ
- 2 unchanged: ADEXI, GMS
- 8 new skill mappings to add, 0 removals

See THR-199 Step 2.5 spec for detailed update instructions.
