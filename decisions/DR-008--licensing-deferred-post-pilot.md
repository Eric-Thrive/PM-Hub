# DR-008: Defer instrument licensing to post-pilot phase

**Date:** 2026-02-10
**Status:** Accepted
**Product:** C2A
**Issues:** THR-17, THR-18, THR-19

## Context

Several instruments in the C2A battery are published psychological assessments that require licensing for commercial distribution. Licensing outreach (THR-17/18/19) was initially on the critical path, potentially blocking assessment content development. Research into academic licensing norms clarified the distinction between pilot/research use and commercial distribution.

## Decision

Instrument licensing is not required for the NLU pilot phase (15 students, research/educational context). Licensing becomes critical only for commercial distribution at scale. This removes licensing from the critical path for M2 (March 1) and M3 (March 15), allowing the team to focus on technical implementation. Licensing issues remain open in Linear as future requirements.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Pursue licensing before pilot** — Rejected because licensing negotiations can take months and would blow the March 1 deadline; pilot use falls within standard academic fair use
- **Use only open/custom instruments** — Rejected because it would weaken the psychometric validity of the battery; the norm-referenced instruments provide calibrated benchmarks essential for the profile

## Consequences

Technical implementation can proceed without waiting for licensing. The battery design is not constrained by licensing status. However, any expansion beyond the NLU pilot or any commercial pricing requires completing the licensing process first. This creates a future gate between pilot success and commercial scaling.
