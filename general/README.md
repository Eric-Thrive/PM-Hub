# General Deliverables

Cross-product specs, analyses, templates, and reference docs that don't belong to a single product.

Product-specific deliverables go in their product directory:
- `c2a/` — C2A / LE3 Assessment
- `accommodation-engine/` — Accommodation Engine
- `pi-redactor/` — PI Redactor
- `bloom-report/` — Bloom Report

## Conventions

- Use descriptive filenames: `claude-code-workflow-analysis.md`, not `notes.md`
- Link every file to a Linear issue (or note in session handoff if unlinked)
